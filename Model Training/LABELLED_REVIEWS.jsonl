{"id":3141,"text":"I know it's a beta version, but there's still a lot of work to do. For starters, the comments section is a bit confusing (it's messy because it lacks visual hierarchy), and it could use some reworking: there should be a better distinction between a comment's header (the part where the commenter's username and flair, and the comment's score are displayed) and the comment's body; Roboto Light should be available for the comments section as well. I also think comment indentation could be a little bigger to emphasize you're going to a deeper level.  On the subreddit view, there should be a maximum size for the thumbnail when the big picture mode is on, so large images don't take up as much screen space. The cards could also be a little tweaked to become more organized, and reduce the overcrowding of information around the title of the post. It would be nice if there was some form of indication so we could know, beforehand, what type of link are we clicking on when big picture mode is NOT activated  is it an image? Gif? Video?  Lastly, search should be more accessible (it could replace the multi-column icon on the action bar), because it's something people do a lot. Also, it should be possible to change the search terms or the subreddit one is searching in without having to go back to the homepage and tap Search again.  Despite all this, Slide is the best Reddit app in the Play Store right now; it just needs a couple of improvements to be the perfect one.","reviewId":"3334bc3d-c016-4b3e-9714-dccf75fe244c","label":[[81,120,"UI \/ Design Issues"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":3232,"text":"Update: Something seriously needs to be done about the Up and Down buttons in the comment thread being too low, too thin and too close to the back button of the phone (Note 5\/Samsung\/any phone with physical back button). It's KILLING THE EXPERIENCE as it is TOO CLOSE TO THE BACK BUTTON so everytime I need to go to the next thread, and I hit the back button by mistake, I exit the comments completely back to the front page! Argh! This doesn't happen with Relay coz their Up\/Down buttons are floating a bit higher and they're bigger. Also, Relay has the advantage of saving your spot in the comments (until you open a new one) and the comment pane doesn't have to reload every single time if you back out of it by mistake. God forbid you've read until the second last thread and exit it by mistake and have to go through it all again to find your spot. Seriously, this issue is teeth grindingly annoying and I honestly am considering going back to Relay only because of this. Even left a comment about this to Dev on a Reddit thread months ago. But Dev doesn't seem as responsive as before. Also, there's no jump by Search in the comments like Relay. Old Review many months back: Thought I'd never use anything after Relay, well, I thought wrong! The 1 thing stopping me from making this my full time client is the lack of filters in comments (the famous Relay fab button). It's nice to jump from thread to thread in Slide comments, but nothing beats the choice of jumping comments based on Time, OP, Gilded, AMA & my personal fave, by Search. It truly changes the reddit experience.","reviewId":"44120b74-6767-43db-8ba2-8488df89a888","label":[[226,248,"User Experience Issues"]],"Comments":[]}

{"id":4229,"text":"Great design and the ad-free app is amazing. The app is my favorite way to browse Reddit on Android but there are some annoyances. Slide could use a good way to view only a few select subreddits. I am subscribed to over 300 subreddits. When trying to manage them in the app, it takes forever to load and even longer to reorder. There needs to be a way to hide subreddits while still being subscribed to them. The app lags because there's no way to hide all the subreddits save for a select few.  When reading comments, scrolling up and down the page causes trouble. Sometimes I'll scroll just a little to the left and the app will take me back to the previous screen. V.reddit are supported and that's a huge plus. It lags when trying to change the post order and starting the app causes a black screen for 8 seconds before loading is finished.

This took some getting used to, there was a bit of a learning curve, but I like it now.  There are a couple features I wish could be changed: I wish you could add your whole favorites list to your queue in one action, instead of one by one And, I wish the process of searching for podcasts was a little more intuitive. Maybe I just got spoiled in the past, but the only part of adding a podcast that I don't mind, is when adding by URL. That was super easy, relatively. And I have yet to find a way to download an episode form a podcast without subscribing to it first. And then, when you do subscribe, you have to tap through to open the podcast before you can do anything further ... Ok, I may have harped a bit on the process of adding a new podcast, but so far, it hasn't left me looking for another podcast app Thanks for the hard work","reviewId":"9767e20b-86b7-4a6b-a73d-8cc941c568ae","Comments":[],"label":[[321,418,"UI \/ Design Issues"],[424,497,"UI \/ Design Issues"]]}

{"id":22803,"text":"Out of the 5 podcast players I've tried in the last few weeks this is BY FAR the best. Clean - easy to manoeuvre. Has options for swiping left\/right on episodes and you can choose which action. No messy ad pictures as you can get with other apps. Works seamlessly so far. The only thing I'm missing which I found on another app is the ability to create different playlists so you can sort your favourite episodes into categories.
