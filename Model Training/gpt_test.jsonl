{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"For the following review: I know it's a beta version, but there's still a lot of work to do. For starters, the comments section is a bit confusing (it's messy because it lacks visual hierarchy), and it could use some reworking: there should be a better distinction between a comment's header (the part where the commenter's username and flair, and the comment's score are displayed) and the comment's body; Roboto Light should be available for the comments section as well. I also think comment indentation could be a little bigger to emphasize you're going to a deeper level.  On the subreddit view, there should be a maximum size for the thumbnail when the big picture mode is on, so large images don't take up as much screen space. The cards could also be a little tweaked to become more organized, and reduce the overcrowding of information around the title of the post. It would be nice if there was some form of indication so we could know, beforehand, what type of link are we clicking on when big picture mode is NOT activated  is it an image? Gif? Video?  Lastly, search should be more accessible (it could replace the multi-column icon on the action bar), because it's something people do a lot. Also, it should be possible to change the search terms or the subreddit one is searching in without having to go back to the homepage and tap Search again.  Despite all this, Slide is the best Reddit app in the Play Store right now; it just needs a couple of improvements to be the perfect one. , extract any of these labels in the review:  Content and Media Issues, Crashing Issues, UI \/ Design Issues, Performance Issues, Functionality Issues, User Experience Issues, Developer Related Issues, Security Related Issues. return the start and end index of the label in the review."},{"role":"assistant","content":"[[81, 120, 'UI \/ Design Issues']]"}]}
